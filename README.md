# Guardword

Guardword is a console-based Java project that evaluates the strength of a user's password. It provides a simple and efficient way to determine the strength of a password based on various criteria, including length, complexity, and uniqueness.

## Features

- Password Strength Evaluation: Guardword analyzes the password entered by the user and provides a comprehensive evaluation of its strength.
- Length Check: The program verifies the length of the password and considers longer passwords to be generally stronger.
- Complexity Analysis: Guardword examines the password for complexity, including the presence of different character types like uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Uniqueness Assessment: Guardword compares the entered password against known common passwords and advises the user against using them.

## Usage

Once you have launched Guardword, follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the program. Here's an example of a typical usage scenario:

1. Enter the password you want to evaluate.

2. Guardword will analyze the password based on its length, complexity, and uniqueness.

3. The program will provide a detailed evaluation of the password's strength, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.

4. Take note of the recommendations provided by Guardword to improve the password's strength if necessary.

5. You can rerun the program to evaluate different passwords.
